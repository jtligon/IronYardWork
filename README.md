# IronYardWork
Onboarding assignments for The Ironyard

# Rewriting History
The IronYard arose out of collaborators at Cowork Greeneville in 2011. It started out as a startup accelerator that would mentor small teams as they set out to change the world. Mason Stewart, a member of the coworking community, approached The Ironyard, requesting time and space for teaching a coding class for kids, and after seeing the amazing results, Peter Barth and Eric Dodds decide to use this model of deep intensive coding classes to fill the deepening need for programmers in the tech industry.
